## Aphorisms / Adages / Epigrams

#### [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)

> Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected

For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number
of possible and more complex alternatives, but simpler theories are more preferable
because they are easily testable. This is a line of reasoning often used in daily life.

#### [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)

> Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.

A special case of Occam's razor, the history of this aphorism is controversial,
but the applications are endless. [Miscommunications are often attributed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/48#issuecomment-118540912)
to this aphorism in Open Source Projects.

#### [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)

> If anything can go wrong -- it will.

People most often relate with `If there is a worse time for something to go wrong,
it will happen then.`, especially after the dawn of mobile communication (no coverage
right when you need it most) and the Internet (no connectivity, when you have to send
that one life-changing email.)

[R: Ultimate collections of Murphy's Laws](http://murphyslaws.net/)

#### [Godwin's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law)

> As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1

In many newsgroups, it is a tradition in which whoever mentions the Nazis automatically
loses the debate that was going on, and the thread is finished there and then. Also, popularly
referred to as `Playing the Hitler card`.

## Psychological Syndromes

#### [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)

> When the victim mistakes a lack of abuse as an act of kindness by the captor.

Traumatic bonding that is most common in kidnapping situations, where the hostages
express sympathy towards the captor, to the point of defending the captors. It may be
attributed to the natural selection process that let our hunter-gatherer ancestors
solve adaptive problems.

#### [Pygmalion effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect)

> the phenomenon whereby higher expectations lead to an increase in performance

The idea behind this effect is that if a leader expects more of a follower, then the follower tends to
improve their performance. Studies of this effect in action are hard to conduct because they are generally
in an artificial, manipulated setting. Also, there is an argument that often the perception of a follower
by the leader directly or indirectly affect the expectations that said leader has from the follower. This
effect was shown to exist in schools in the Rosenthal-Jacobson study.

#### [Golem Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_effect)

> The phenomenon where lower expectations placed upon individuals leads to poorer performance

The Golem effect is the negative corrollary of the Pygmalion Effect: Supervisors
with negative expectations will inadvertently produce behaviours that reduce the
efficiency of their subordinates. This effect has been most rigorously studied
in Classroom settings. Teachers treat students performing poorly with high
negative bias, this in turn leads the students to perform poorly, reinforcing
the teacher's belief. This is one of the most problematic consequences of Golem
Effect in the Classroom. A few studies have also been made on the Golem effect
in the workplace.

#### [Capgras Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion)

> Delusion that an individual's closed ones have been replaced by a double.

![image](./img/Capgras-Syndrome.png)

Capgras Syndrome(a.k.a Capgras Delusion) is a psychiatric disorder in which a
person holds a delusion that a friend, spouse, parent, or other close family
member (or pet) has been replaced by an identical impostor. There is no
definitive diagnosis available.

#### [Hawthorne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect)

> People behave better or improve their productivity when under observation

The Hawthorne effect (a.k.a Observation Bias) was first noticed at Hawthorne
Works in Cicero, IL where the correlation between lighting conditions and
employee producitivty was studied. Critics who doubt that a correlation exists
in reality argue that the Hawthorne effect is a variant of the demand effect.
Richard Nisbett, a distinguished professor of social psychology, has described
the Hawthorne effect as "a glorified anecdote", saying that "once you have got
the anecdote, you can throw away the data."

#### [Placebo Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo)

> Belief in a treatment may be enough to change the course of a person's physical illness.

A placebo is a substance or treatment with no active therapeutic effect. A
placebo may be given to a person in order to deceive the recipient into thinking
that it is an active treatment. In drug testing and medical research, a placebo
can be made to resemble an active medication or therapy so that it functions as
a control; this is to prevent the recipient(s) and/or others from knowing
whether a treatment is active or inactive, as expectations about efficacy can
influence results. In a broad sense, the effect may be viewed as an improvement
in patients' symptoms that are attributable to their participation in the
therapeutic encounter, with it's rituals, symbols, and interactions.

#### [Synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia)

> When stimulation of one sense leads to involuntary experiences in another sense

This neurological phenomenon occurs when stimulation of one sense leads to
involuntary experiences in another sense or a "union of the senses" where for
example taste and sound are joined together.  Some people experience color when
they hear sounds or read words and may be able to answer a question like "What
color is A?" Over 60 types of Synesthesia have been reported. Approximately 1 in
2000 people are believed to have Synesthesia.

#### [Bystander Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect)

> Phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when
> other people are present

![bystander](./img/bystander-effect.jpg)

This effect occurs when the presence of others discourages an individual from
intervening in an emergency situation. When an emergency situation occurs,
observers are more likely to take action if there are few or no other witnesses.
Being part of a large crowd makes it so no single person has to take
responsibility for an action. Knowing that the bystander effect exists
consciously is thought to be enough to prevent it from happening when one is a
bystander in a situation where a victim needs help. If you are the victim
seeking help, singling out one person in the crowd and appealing to them for
help is often recommended as the best strategy to get any required assistance.

#### [Munchausen
syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_disorder_imposed_on_self)

> Person pretends to have a physical or mental illness in an attempt to get
> seek attention

![munchausen](./img/munchausen-syndrome.png)

Munchausen's syndrome is a psychological and behavioural condition where someone
pretends to be ill or induces symptoms of illness in themselves. Their main
intention is to assume the "sick role" to have people care for them and be the
centre of attention. People with this disorder are often willing to undergo
painful and risky tests in order to get the sympathy and special attention given
to people who are truly ill. People suffering from this syndrome suffer from
severe emotional difficulties.

#### [Munchausen syndrome by
proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_disorder_imposed_on_another)

> Person acts as if an individual he or she is caring for has an illness when
> the person is not really sick.

![munchausen-by-proxy](./img/munchausen-by-proxy.png)

Munchausen by proxy syndrome is a relatively rare form of child abuse that
involves the exaggeration or fabrication of illnesses or symptoms by a primary
caretaker. The adult perpetrator lies about illness in another person under his
or her care, usually a child under 6 years of age. The female antagonist of the
book [Sharp Objects by Gillian
Flynn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18045891-sharp-objects) suffered from
this disorder.
